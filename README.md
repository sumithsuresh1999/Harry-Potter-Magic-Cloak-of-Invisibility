# Harry-Potter-Magic-Cloak-of-Invisibility
Harry Potter's Magic Cloak with OpenCV, Python. 

Take a nice thick red coloured cloth.

Run the code and for the first few seconds move away from the camera (DO NOT GO/SIT/STAND INFRONT of the camera), so that the camera captures only the background.

Now take the red cloth, cover your face/whole body/hands with it, and go infront the camera.

The area which is occupied by the red cloth becomes invisible.
